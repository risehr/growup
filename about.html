        <h4>Sarvahitey- VISION</h4>
        <div id=abouttext>
            <span>
                <h6>‘Sarvahitey’ is a Sanskrit term, made from combination of two smaller words: ‘Sarva’ and ‘Hit’.
                    While ‘Sarva’ means ‘all’, ‘Hit’ means ‘welfare’. ‘Sarvahitey’ thus means ‘In the welfare of all’.:

    </div>

    <div id=text1>
        <p>
            Sarvahitey was formed keeping in view the fact that a majority of Indian population is devoid of basic
            needs, and basic infrastructure to self-realize those needs. Being a group of socially conscientious
            members, Sarvahitey was formed to cater to the underprivileged, their needs, and gradually making them
            self-sufficient to fulfil their personal, familial, financial and societal obligations. Through the years,
            Sarvahitey, as an organisation, has made ample efforts, and executed numerous projects to enhance the
            conditions of the underprivileged, with the following vision in mind:

        <span>Social Awareness and Empathy</span>
    </div>

    <div id=text1>
        <p>
            Sarvahitey believes that there is a natural tendency for everyone to love. And this love goes unaccounted
            for when though there is empathy in people towards people of a lower financial standing, they are hardly
            able to employ themselves towards bridging that gap. Therefore, Sarvahitey, as its prime vision, has taken
            upon itself to raise social awareness among people, and utilize the empathy to bring out a social activist
            in each household. When everyone does some good, the nation becomes better, multi-fold. Sarvahitey plans to
            imbibe in each, a sense of being socially responsible. Social Service, therefore, should be made a culture
            among everyone.

        <span>The Fountain Effect</span>
    </div>

    <div id=text1>
        <p>
            Sarvahitey has an immense belief in the ability of the rural and labour class to transform the entire
            structure and function of the country. Due to the fact that 2/3rds of the population of the country is
            dependent upon agriculture, and therefore, rural progress, Sarvahitey has obliged itself to raise the
            standards of the Indian rural/agricultural economy, to bring it under the purview of globalized development.
            Sarvahitey has tremendous faith in the ‘Trickle-Up’ or ‘Fountain Effect’, wherein the progress of the entire
            country will be reflected in the progress of the villages of the country.
